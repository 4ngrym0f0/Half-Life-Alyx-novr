# Setup
1. Install [SteamVR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/).
2. Follow the instructions of [this video](https://youtu.be/66HIE3DFfjo)
3. Set the resolution (1920x1080 or other necessary for you) for fullscreen mode. You can see how it is configured in more detail [here](https://youtu.be/K_I5fm-cT6Y?t=2).
4. SteamVR starts and in the SteamVR status window click -> Room settings -> Small room -> Calibration -> 170 cm.
5. For Steam, go to the game properties, click on the launch options and enter `+ vr_gg_gesture_pull 0`. For a regular shortcut, go to the shortcut properties and add the same: `"C:\Games\Half-Life Alyx\bin\win64\hlvr.exe"+ vr_gg_gesture_pull 0`. This is necessary so that objects are [pulled up by one button](https://youtu.be/RWQbwlXjtjI).
6. Run the game, select the game and click on it, then press ALT + TAB and switch to the "Headset Window" and click. The SteamVR status window and SteamVR messages can be hidden.
7. In the game settings select "Movement: Sliding" (for smooth walking as in regular games).

Also study the descriptions of the buttons, if you cannot pass at some point, read the instructions and see the walkthrough manuals on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcuoRRWRvb7xUuMzrEqCZ5w).


If you are running SteamVR Home, then go into SteamVR settings and disable its autostart when SteamVR starts.
