# Setup
1. Install [SteamVR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/).
2. Follow the instructions of [this video](https://youtu.be/66HIE3DFfjo)
3. Set the resolution (1920x1080 or other necessary for you) for fullscreen mode. You can see how it is configured in more detail [here](https://youtu.be/K_I5fm-cT6Y?t=2).
4. SteamVR starts and in the SteamVR status window click -> Room settings -> Small room -> Calibration -> 170 cm. The SteamVR tutorial can be closed, and SteamVR Home is disabled in the SteamVR settings.
5. For Steam, go to the game properties, click on the launch options and enter `+ vr_gg_gesture_pull 0`. For a regular shortcut, go to the shortcut properties and add the same: `"C:\Games\Half-Life Alyx\bin\win64\hlvr.exe"+ vr_gg_gesture_pull 0`. This is necessary so that objects are [pulled up by one button](https://youtu.be/RWQbwlXjtjI).
6. Run the game, select the game and click on it, then press ALT + TAB and switch to the "Headset Window" and click. The SteamVR status window and SteamVR messages can be hidden.
7. In the game settings select "Movement: Sliding" (for smooth walking as in regular games) and turn off the rotation (so that the inscription use the rotation does not interfere).

Also study the descriptions of the buttons, if you cannot pass at some point, read the instructions and see the walkthrough manuals on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcuoRRWRvb7xUuMzrEqCZ5w).


If you are running SteamVR Home, then go into SteamVR settings and disable its autostart when SteamVR starts.



Start SteamVR first and only then the game.
