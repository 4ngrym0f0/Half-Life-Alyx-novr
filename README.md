# Half Life Alyx no VR driver
Driver allows to play in [Half-Life: Alyx](https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/) without VR on keyboard and mouse. It is not clear yet whether it will be possible to go through the whole game in this way, but if in some place a problem arises, can use saves or other methods to bypass the problem moment in the game.

## Setup
Detailed setup process can be seen in [this video](https://youtu.be/66HIE3DFfjo). 



After installing SteamVR and TrueOpenVR, need to go to the SteamVR state window -> Setup room -> Small room -> Calibrate-> 170cm.



Also must add launch options.

For Steam, go to the gameâ€™s properties, click on the launch options and enter `+ vr_gg_gesture_pull 0`. For a regular shortcut, go to the shortcut properties and add the same `"C:\Games\Half-Life Alyx\bin\win64\hlvr.exe" +vr_gg_gesture_pull 0`.


After starting the console, must enter the console `vr_gg_gesture_pull 0`. This is necessary so that objects are [pulled up without movement](https://youtu.be/RWQbwlXjtjI).



In the game settings, you need to select "Movement: Smooth" (for smooth walking as in regular games).



**Warning!** Select the "Headset Window" or press "F7" for the driver to work.
